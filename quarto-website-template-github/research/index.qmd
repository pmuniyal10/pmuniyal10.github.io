title: "Education and Research"
---

I have always been driven by curiosity and a passion for discovery. My journey in cardiovascular research and education reflects a commitment to advancing science and making a meaningful impact in medicine.

## Education
My academic path has provided me with the foundation to bridge the gap between biotechnology and patient-centered healthcare.

**Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology**  
*Kent State University*  
Equipped with expertise in molecular biology, genetics, and research methodologies.

**Masterâ€™s in Clinical Epidemiology**  
*Kent State University (Class of 2026)*  
Pursuing advanced training to combine my research background with Epidemiology.

## Research

Through my work as a research assistant at **Case Western Reserve University**, I explored the molecular underpinnings of cardiovascular disease, with a particular focus on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Using advanced techniques like echocardiography, telemetry, and histology, I contributed to uncovering how N-terminal truncated cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBPC) affects heart function.

### Key Contributions:
- Conducted preclinical studies to explore therapeutic approaches for cardiac dysfunction.
- Advanced gene delivery techniques, including AAV9-mediated therapy, to restore cardiac function.
- Investigated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using murine models, uncovering insights that bridge molecular research and clinical applications.
